# Titanic Classification Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and survival status.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-classification.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the data preprocessing script:
    ```bash
    python src/preprocess.py
    ```
2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python src/train.py
    ```

## Results
Details about the model's performance and evaluation metrics will be added here.
